 > Blood power = 10
 > Ritual of creation -> eldritch blob
> The eldritch blob sings. Someone knocks at your door. 1 cult member gained. (Maybe first cult member is a cat). Recruit cat, recruit crow. X blood powre to recruit each. 

(You slide the blob into your pocket and walk around. A cat comes up and sniffs at you and follows you home.)
Spiders for minor blood magic but very cheap
Dogs to lure people in?
(And non-human cult members can only do 1 specific thingo)
Spider price increases slower. Buy 1, buy 10, buy 15
